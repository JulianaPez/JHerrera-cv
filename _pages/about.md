I am a biologist with a degree from the University of Antioquia,
where I also completed my master's degree. Over the past eight years, I
have focused my research on aquatic ecosystems in the northern Andes.
Freshwater aquatic systems are interesting to me because even though
they represent a minimal surface of the planet, they have given rise to
ecological and evolutionary processes that have resulted in a great
diversity of species and interactions.

During my undergraduate studies, I specialized in fish community
ecology, and for my master's research, I explored population
genetics and phylogeography. Currently, as a PhD student at
<a href="https://maevolab.mx/" target="_blank">Maevolab</a> in
<a href="https://www.inecol.mx/" target="_blank">Instituto de Ecolog√≠a INECOL.AC</a>,
my primary research interest is understanding how specific
biotic and abiotic factors have influenced
freshwater fish diversification on a global scale.
