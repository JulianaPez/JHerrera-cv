I am a **biologist** with a degree from the **University of Antioquia**, where I also completed my master's degree. Over the past eight years, I have focused my research on aquatic ecosystems in the northern Andes. Freshwater aquatic systems are interesting to me because even though they represent a minimal surface of the planet, they have given rise to ecological and evolutionary processes that have resulted in a great diversity of species and interactions.

During my undergraduate studies, I specialized in **fish community ecology**, and for my master's research, I explored **population genetics** and **phylogeography**. Currently, as a PhD student at INECOL, my primary research interest is understanding how specific biotic and abiotic traits of freshwater fish species have influenced their diversification on a global scale.
